                            Hi I'm Kez and welcome to my little Kawaii spaces! I
                            basically love Unicorns, Japanese Pop Culture and
                            all things Kawaii, but that aesthetic isn't
                            everything. I do social commentary and currently
                            have a series called Makeup &amp; Mental Health
                            Mondays, another called This Is Not Tea, where I
                            talk about YouTube "Tea"/Drama from a different
                            perspective. I do have other content including Wig
                            Reviews, Get Ready With Me's, Fashion &amp; Styling
                            and have more planned and am always keen to hear
                            what you would like to see from me.
